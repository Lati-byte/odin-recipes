        <p>These brownies require one bowl and come together in minutes. 
        There’s also a good chance you already have the ingredients on
         hand. Let me walk you through the steps for making them. Now 
         if you love simple recipes like this one, take a look at these
          blondies or my favorite chocolate chip cookies. Both are excellent!</p>

          <p>This recipe is slightly adapted from Alice Medrich’s Cocoa Brownies found
           in many of her cookbooks. Medrich is a genius when it comes to chocolate.
            Search on Google and you’ll see that some brownie recipes call for 
            chocolate that is melted into butter, then mixed with sugar, eggs, and 
            flour. This recipe is different — and smart.
            Instead of using chocolate, Medrich calls for cocoa powder. In removing the 
            chocolate (as well as the fat and sugar that goes along with it), she was 
            fine-tuned the brownies so that the middles were softer and moist and the tops
            were shiny and candy-like. The recipe is pure gold.</p>
