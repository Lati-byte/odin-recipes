        <h1>Chocolate mousse recipe</h1>
        <img src="../img/mousse.jpg">
        <p>Don’t let the French name fool you: chocolate 
            mousse is one of the easiest desserts to make.
             Seriously, if you have a microwave, a hand mixer
             , and a rubber spatula, you can make homemade 
             chocolate mousse to rival any French restaurant’s
              version — and you can do it in 20 minutes. This 
              recipe from Tyler Florence is virtually foolproof
              . I have experimented with adding a hit of coffee
               or booze to enhance the flavor; both versions are 
               good but the family consensus is that plain chocolate 
               is best. Keep it simple!</p>
               <h3>Ingredients</h3>
               <ul>
                <li>Sugar</li>
                <li>Flour</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Vannila</li>
                <li>Whip cream</li>
                <li>Semi-sweet chocolate</li>
                <li>3 eggs</li>
                <li>Olive oil</li>
               </ul>
               <h3>Steps</h3>
               <ol>
                <li>To begin, place the butter in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Break the chocolate into small pieces directly into the bowl (no need to chop it first and dirty a cutting board).

                </li>
                <li>Microwave it in 20-second intervals, stirring between each bout of heat, until the chocolate is about 75% melted. Stir, allowing the residual heat in the bowl to melt the chocolate completely.</li>
                <li>Let the mixture cool for a few minutes, then add the egg yolks one at a time.</li>
                <li>Whisk until smooth after each addition and then aside.</li>
                <li>In another medium bowl, beat the egg whites until foamy. Add the cream of tartar and beat until soft peaks form</li>
                <li>Gradually beat in 1/4 cup of the sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form</li>
                <li>Using a large rubber spatula, fold the egg white mixture into the chocolate mixture.</li>
                <li>In another bowl, beat the heavy cream until it begins to thicken up. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar and the vanilla.</li>

               </ol>
